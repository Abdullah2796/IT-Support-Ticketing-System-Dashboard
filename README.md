# IT Support Ticketing System Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project focuses on creating an interactive dashboard for an IT support ticketing system using Power BI. The goal of the dashboard is to track and analyze the performance and efficiency of the IT support team by monitoring open, closed, and aging tickets. The project visualizes key metrics such as proactive measures, QA/QC processes, and monthly trends to help optimize support operations.

## Features
- **Overall Open Tickets by Support Team**: Visualize the open support tickets assigned to different IT support teams (Helpdesk, Network Operations, etc.) using a donut chart.
- **Open Tickets by Urgency**: Display the number of open tickets grouped by urgency levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low) in a donut chart.
- **Proactive Support Tickets by Support Team**: Show the distribution of proactive support tickets (e.g., system checks, software patching) by team.
- **Monthly Trend of Closed Tickets**: A line chart tracking the trend of resolved support tickets over time, helping to understand workload and efficiency.
- **Proactive and QA/QC Ticket Trends**: Display monthly trends for proactive support and QA/QC ticket closures.
- **Assigned vs Closed Tickets**: Bar chart comparing the number of assigned tickets versus closed tickets on a monthly basis.
- **Open Tickets Aging**: Track aging tickets to identify overdue support tickets requiring urgent attention.
- **Slicers for Filtering**: Filter the dashboard by department (Support Team) and ticket status (Open, In Progress, Resolved, Escalated).

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: Used for data visualization and creating an interactive dashboard.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Used to calculate key metrics and add custom logic for complex filtering and aggregation.

## Key Visuals
1. **Donut Charts**: 
   - Visualize open tickets by support team, urgency, and priority.
2. **Line Charts**: 
   - Track trends in ticket closures, including proactive and QA/QC processes.
3. **Bar Charts**: 
   - Show comparisons such as assigned vs closed tickets and aging tickets by team.
4. **Slicers**: 
   - Filters for department (support team) and ticket status for interactive exploration of the data.

## Project Insights
- **Efficiency Improvements**: This dashboard helps identify bottlenecks in support operations, such as aging tickets or teams that need additional resources.
- **Proactive Measures**: Visualizing proactive tickets helps track preventative measures and ensure they are reducing the incoming ticket load.
- **Quality Assurance**: The QA/QC ticket tracking ensures that support resolutions are thoroughly verified, helping to maintain service quality.

## Conclusion
This IT support ticketing system dashboard provides a comprehensive view of support operations, helping IT teams optimize their processes, track performance, and ensure timely resolutions. The interactive dashboard makes it easier to gain insights into how teams are managing tickets and where improvements are needed.
